					<h2>Meet Sophie</h2>
					<p class="story-intro">...the simple story of a girafe born on May 25th in the year 1961, Saint Sophie's day.</p><br>
					<p>In those days, the only animal toys available were farm animals and pet figures...</p>
					<p>That is why one day in France, a certain Monsieur RAMPEAU, who was an expert in transforming the <b>latex from the HEVEA</b> tree using the rotational moulding of rubber as a toy-making concept, came up with the idea of designing a giraffe. Such an exotic wildlife figure would be a first on the market, and its size and shape would be ideal for a baby's small hand to grasp.</p>
					<p>Sophie la girafe, who looked exactly the same than she does today, went into production on a Thursday, May 25th, hence her name.</p>
					<p>She was an immediate success. Young parents immediately recognized that she was a must for their baby... When the first signs of teething appear, Sophie la girafe helps babies stop crying!</p>
					<p>By simple word of mouth, the little giraffe's fame spread. From then on around the world, generations upon generations of children were to love hearing Sophie squeak whenever they pressed her tummy or head!</p>
					<p>VULLI, a company based in Rumilly in the Haute-Savoie region of France has continued to keep the highly guarded secret of how this wonder toy is made.</p>
					<p>To this day, Sophie la girafe is still traditionally produced, a process that involves more than 14 manual operations.</p>
					<p>She is made from 100% natural rubber derived from the latex of the Hevea tree.</p>

				<h3>Sight</h3>
				<p>At the age of 3 months, a baby's eyesight is still limited and he can only make out high contrasts.</p><br>
				<p>The dark and contrasting attention-catching spots all over Sophie la girafe's body provide visual stimulation and she soon becomes a familiar and reassuring object for baby.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item-info-box item-info-4">
				<h3>Hearing</h3>
				<p>Sophie la girafe's squeaker keeps baby amused and stimulates his hearing. To begin with, the funny sound she makes when she is squeezed helps to stimulate his hearing, and then later, helps him to understand the link between cause and effect.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item-info-box item-info-2">	
				<h3>Smell</h3>
				<p>The singular scent of natural rubber from the Hevea tree makes Sophie la girafe very special and easy for your child to identify amid all his other toys.</p>

			<div class="item-info-box item-info-5">	
				<h3>Taste</h3>
				<p>Made of 100% natural rubber and food-grade paints, she is completely safe to chew. Sophie la girafe is akin to the nipple of a feeding-bottle. Her soft texture and numerous chewable parts (ears, horns, legs), makes her perfect for soothing baby's sore gums during teething.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item-info-box item-info-3">	
				<h3>Touch</h3>
				<p>Touch is the first means a baby has to communicate with the outside world.</p><br>
				<p>Sophie la girafe's soft feel, like baby's mother's skin, stimulates physiological and emotional responses that soothe baby and promote healthy growth and well-being.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item-info-box item-info-6">
				<h3>Easy to grip</h3>
				<p>Thanks to her shape and 18cm size, Sophie la girafe is perfect for baby's small hands. She is very light, and her long legs and neck make it easy for baby to grip, even from his earliest days.</p>
